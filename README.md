# Quadratic Equation Solver

The program allows you in a convenient mode (there are two modes: interactive and reading from a file) to get the general form of a quadratic equation based on the given coefficients, to find out how many roots the equation contains, and to get the roots of a quadratic equation.

## How to build
1. Clone the repository from Github to your computer using Git or Github Desktop. Alternatively this could be done right inside Visual Studio
2. Open Visual Studio and select "Open a project or solution" from the main menu. Find the project file (.sln) in the cloned repository and open it.
3. Press the key combination "Ctrl + Shift + B" or select the menu item "Build" -> "Build Solution" to compile the application.
4. After successful compilation, you can run the program by pressing "F5" key or selecting "Debug" -> "Start Debugging" from the Visual Studio menu.

If you get any error while compiling, make sure that all dependencies and required libraries are installed and configured correctly on your system. You can also check the compiler and linker settings in Visual Studio.
